# Bit Manipulation

`Bit Manipulation`: It manipulates integers on bit levels.

## Java Bitwise Operators

| operator | Name | Description|
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| & | AND | Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1 |
| \| | OR | Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1 |
| ^ | XOR | Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1 |
| ~ | NOT | Inverts all the bits |
| << | signed left shift | Shifts left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off |
| >> | signed right shift | Shifts right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the right most bits fall off |
| <<< | unsigned left shift | Shifts left by pushing zeroes in from the right, and let the leftmost bits fall off |
| >>> | unsigned right shift | Shifts right by pushing zeroes in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off |
