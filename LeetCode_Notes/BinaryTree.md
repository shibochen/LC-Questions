# Important Notes about Binary Tree

## Tree Terminology
- **Internal Nodes** : The node which has at least one child
- **Degree** 
  - **Degree of the Node** : The total number of children of a node
  - **Degree of the Tree** : The highest degree of a node among all the nodes
- **Height** 
  - **Height of the Node** : The total number of edges from leaf node to a particular node in the largest path
  - **Height of the Tree** : The height of the root node
- **Depth**
  - **Depth of the Node** : The total number of edges from root node to a particular node.
  - **Depth of the Tree** : The total number of edges from root to leaf in the longest path
- **Path** : The sequence of nodes and edges between two nodes
- **Length of a Path** : Thet total number of nodes in that path
  

## Binary Tree Traversal 
- Breadth First Traversal (BFS)
- Depth First Traversals (DFS)
  - Preorder Traversal (Root-Left-Right)
  - Inorder Traversal (Left-Root-Right)
  - Postorder Traversal (Left-Right-Root)
